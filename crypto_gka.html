<h1>5.2.1. Group Key Agreement (GKA)<a class="headerlink" href="#group-key-agreement-gka" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The group key agreement is conducted according to CLIQUES <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#cliq" id="id1">[00CLIQ]</a>.  We modify
the protocol to use ECDH based on x25519 instead of classic DH, since it is
superior in all attributes &#8211; faster to process, smaller keys to transport and
store, and existing libraries are simpler to interface with.  It negotiates a
shared group key for <span class="math">\(n\)</span> members in a total of <span class="math">\(O(n)\)</span> messages
sent, and re-negotiates (single-member) include, exclude or key refresh in
<span class="math">\(O(1)\)</span> messages, assuming broadcasts are available.</p>
<p>The CLIQUES key agreement algorithm is based on the Group-Diffie-Hellman (GDH)
concept, in which each participant generates a private contributory key portion
for the session.  This will be computed into the (public) intermediate keys
passed between the members.  At the end of the process, a set of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>
intermediate keys will be available to all, with each of them lacking the
private contribution of exactly <em>one</em> participant.  Each participant uses that
one respective intermediate key missing their own contribution to compute the
<em>same</em> shared group key.</p>
<p>Based on this GDH concept two related protocols are constructed: The initial
key agreement (IKA) and the auxiliary key agreement (AKA).  IKA is used for an
initial key agreement with no initial knowledge of intermediate keys of the
other parties.  AKA is a supplementary and simplified protocol to agree on an
new, changed group key once the IKA protocol has successfully terminated.  It
is executed on including or excluding participants as well as refreshing the
shared group key.</p>
<p>Besides their slightly different actions within the group key agreement (e.g.
initiator of upflow or of downflow, see below), no participant of the IKA or
AKA bear a special role.  All participants of the CLIQUES key agreement can be
considered equal in terms of the protocol functionality.</p>
<p>CLIQUES does <strong>not</strong> protect against active attackers.  However, in our use of
it, all messages are co-located with our Authenticated Signature Key Exchange
(ASKE) messages, which authenticates each full message in the whole protocol.
Therefore, an active attack is countered by the final <a class="reference internal" href="crypto_aske.html#aske-verification"><span>ASKE verification</span></a> step.</p>
<div class="section" id="initial-key-agreement-ika">
<h2>5.2.1.1. Initial Key Agreement (IKA)<a class="headerlink" href="#initial-key-agreement-ika" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The initial key agreement follows the outline of the <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#cliq" id="id2">[00CLIQ]</a> IKA.1 protocol.
The protocol contains two phases: The <em>upflow</em> phase and the <em>downflow</em> phase.
In the upflow, each participant generates their private key contribution, and
mixes it into the elements of the (growing) chain of intermediate keys.  Once
everyone has participated in the upflow, the last participant will initiate the
downflow by broadcasting the final chain of intermediate keys to all, enabling
them to individually compute the group key.</p>
<div class="section" id="upflow">
<h3>5.2.1.1.1. Upflow<a class="headerlink" href="#upflow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first participant assembles an ordered list of all participants included in
the IKA, with themselves as the first element.  Then, it generates its private
Diffie-Hellman key <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> and computes the corresponding public key using
DH exponentation.  In the case of mpENC, this is x25519 scalar multiplication
with the base point <span class="math">\(G\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math">\(x_1G\)</span>.  Then it generates a list of
intermediate keys to pass onto the next particiant in the list.  The initial
portion of the list (excluding the final element) are intermediate keys lacking
its own contribution; for the first participant, this is simply <span class="math">\((G)\)</span>.
The last &#8211; or <em>cardinal</em> &#8211; element is an intermediate key that contains <em>all</em>
previous participants&#8217; contributions; for the first participant, this is
<span class="math">\((x_1G)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Successive participants receiving the upflow messages similarly generate their
own private contributions.  This contribution is used for computing new
intermediate keys using DH exponentation.  The previous cardinal generates two
items in the new list &#8211; itself unaltered, inserted just before the new
cardinal key, and also the new cardinal key, which is the previous cardinal key
multiplied with their own contribution.</p>

<p>The following figure shows the sequence of upflow messages (<span class="math">\(u_i\)</span>) sent
among four participants (<span class="math">\(p_i\)</span>).</p>

<h3>5.2.1.1.2. Downflow<a class="headerlink" href="#downflow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The last participant in the chain performs the same operations by adding their
own contributions to the intermediate keys.  However, the cardinal key at this
stage is complete, containing contributions from everyone.  Therefore, the last
participant retains the new cardinal key as the shared group secret, and
broadcasts the list of other intermediate keys to <em>all</em> other members.  After
that, the participant has finished their participation in the IKA protocol and
possesses the shared group secret, then computes the group key from it.</p>
<p>Each recipient of the downflow message will now be able to take &#8220;their&#8221;
intermediate key out of the list (i.e. the one missing their own contribution).
For the <span class="math">\(i\)</span>-th member in the chain, this is the <span class="math">\(i\)</span>-th intermediate
key.  Through DH exponentiation of their own private key contribution with
&#8220;their&#8221; intermediate key, they will all derive the same shared secret.  This is
the point this participant has also completed its part in the IKA and has
transitioned into the ready state.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>The following figure shows the corresponding downflow message (<span class="math">\(d\)</span>)

<h2>5.2.1.2. Auxiliary Key Agreement (AKA)<a class="headerlink" href="#auxiliary-key-agreement-aka" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once an initialised chat encryption is available for an established group of
participants, an auxiliary key agreement (AKA) can be invoked.  These runs are
necessary for changes in group participants (including new members or excluding
existing ones) to update the group secret.  Therefore allowing the previous
participant set only to read messages before the AKA, and the new participant
set to read/write messages after the AKA.  Furthermore the AKA can also be used
to refresh the group secret, for more fine-grained forward secrecy, by updating
a participant&#8217;s private key contribution.</p>
<div class="section" id="member-inclusion">
<span id="gka-member-include"></span><h3>5.2.1.2.1. Member Inclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#member-inclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Member inclusion is performed very similarly to the IKA protocol.  An existing
participant may initiate an upflow for this.  First the new participant(s) are
appended to the list of existing participants.  To avoid the new participants
gaining knowledge of the previous group secret, the initiator of the include is
required to update its private key contribution in the following fashion:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Perform a DH exponentiation with its own private contribution on its &#8220;own&#8221;
intermediate key (as if it was generating the old group secret), then append
it to the list of intermediate keys for each new member.  Note that this is
a secret value and must not be sent yet! The next steps hide it.</li>
<li>Generate a new private key contribution (see <a class="reference internal" href="#note-key-contributions"><span>Updating Private Key Contributions</span></a>).</li>
<li>Perform DH exponentiations on all intermediate keys, except its &#8220;own&#8221;, with
the new private key contribution.</li>
</ol>
<p>The upflow is now initiated by sending this list of updated intermediate keys
to the (first of the) new participant(s) to include.  The new participant(s)
perform the key agreement protocol in exactly the same fashion as done in the
IKA upflow by generating their own private key contributions, performing DH
computations with them on the intermediate keys and extending the intermediate
key list with their &#8220;own&#8221; intermediate key.</p>
<p>The last (new) participant in the extended list now will initiate the downflow
broadcast message consisting of <em>all</em> intermediate keys, thus enabling every
participant to compute the new shared group secret and reach a ready state.</p>
<p>Using the AKA for includes it is possible to add new participants either one by
one or multiple at the same time.  It is more efficient to add multiple new
participants at the same time than to add them sequentially.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>The following figure shows inclusion of a participant (<span class="math">\(p5\)</span>) &#8211; initiated
by <span class="math">\(p1\)</span> &#8211; to the existing group of four participants.</p>

<div class="section" id="member-exclusion">
<h3>5.2.1.2.2. Member Exclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#member-exclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The AKA protocol flow for member exclusion is similar to &#8211; but simpler &#8211; than
member inclusion.  The initiator updates their private key contribution (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#note-key-contributions"><span>Updating Private Key Contributions</span></a>) in the same manner as for includes above.  Then
the participant(s) as well as their intermediate key(s) are removed from the
respective lists for the participant(s) to be excluded.  Now the downflow
broadcast message can be sent directly without the need of a preceding upflow
phase.  Thus, all remaining participants can compute the new shared group
secret and reach a ready state.</p>
<p>When using the AKA for exclusion it is possible to remove participants either
one by one or multiple at the same time.  It is more efficient to remove
multiple participants at the same time than to remove them sequentially.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="key-refresh">
<h3>5.2.1.2.3. Key Refresh<a class="headerlink" href="#key-refresh" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To help more granular forward secrecy over extended periods of key use, it is a
good idea to refresh the group secret at suitable intervals (e.g. depending on
time, number of messages or volume encrypted with it).  A key refresh is very
simple, and can be initiated by <em>any</em> participant.  The initiating participant
renews their own private key contribution (see <a class="reference internal" href="#note-key-contributions"><span>Updating Private Key Contributions</span></a>),
and broadcasts a downflow message with all updated intermediate keys to all
participants without the need of a preceding upflow.  Thus, all participants
can compute the new shared group key and reach a ready state.</p>
<p>It is wise for participants to track the &#8220;age&#8221; of their own private key
contribution.  This mechanism can be used for achieving a &#8220;rolling&#8221; group
secret refresh by always updating the oldest private key contributions of
participants.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="member-departure">
<h2>5.2.1.3. Member Departure<a class="headerlink" href="#member-departure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Member departure is the voluntary parting of a participant rather than an
exclusion initiated by another participant.  In effect it is the same, with the
only difference that the departing member indicates the desire to leave, and a
member exclusion AKA will be initiated upon that by another participant.</p>
<p>In mpENC, this is not a direct concern of the GKA, and works the same way
independently of the particular GKA we choose.  That is, the &#8220;desire to leave&#8221;
is a special data message, sent via the normal mechanism for data messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="updating-private-key-contributions">
<span id="note-key-contributions"></span><h2>5.2.1.4. Updating Private Key Contributions<a class="headerlink" href="#updating-private-key-contributions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When the private key contribution (for an inclusion, exclusion or refresh) is
updated, the client must keep <em>all</em> the key contributions in a list, including
old contributions.  When performing computations to derive a new cardinal key,
this whole list of one&#8217;s own private key contributions needs to be used.</p>
<p>In theory, these individual contributions can be condensed into a single value,
via multiplication modulo the order of the base element (base point in ECC).
However, in x25519 only certain values are valid secret keys; secret inputs not
in the expected format are coerced <a class="footnote-reference" href="#coer" id="id3">[1]</a> into this format, which effectively
changes the value used for the actual mathematical scalar multiplication.  If
we combine secret keys using modular multiplication, this will sometimes result
in a value that is effectively corrupted by typical x25519 APIs.  So, we cannot
do this in practise; we must store all our contributions separately, to be
mixed individually into our intermediate key later.</p>
<p>This sequence may grow big over time, so that the overhead of applying a long
sequence of elliptic curve scalar multiplications can become more significant.
In such cases, it may be worth to re-key the whole session.  We have not yet
implemented this, but will do so if it becomes a problem in practice.</p>
<p>Additionally, we cannot pre-emptively combine old contributions into the
intermediate key, e.g. to add an extra step in our key-update sequence
described in <a class="reference internal" href="#gka-member-include"><span>Member Inclusion</span></a>:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>Perform DH exponentiations on its &#8220;own&#8221; intermediate key, with the <em>old</em>
private key contribution (as from step #1).</li>
</ol>
<p>This would cause us to reveal the group secret of the previous session, namely
<span class="math">\(x_1x_5x_4x_3x_2G\)</span> in the example of the above section, which of course
would be a catastrophic security failure.</p>
